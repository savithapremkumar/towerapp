# Tower app

Bootstrapped using create react app typescript

What's been done:
The LO-FI has been implemented using react and typescript (first time user of typescript)


What could have been done:
- Better state management using ContextAPI
- Responsiveness (assuming a different design for desktop where menu is on the LHS, possibly could have also done some transitions for the menu to make it appear slide in/out)
- There's an error with the submission of card number and cvv that I will try to resolve
- Tests , also run into issues related to node version with tests ATM (first time using react testing library, generally use enzyme and jest)
- Attempt at the backend/API but using Express and Mongo as I am not familiar with .NetCore and MSSQL so would take a week to learn and implement it at minimum
